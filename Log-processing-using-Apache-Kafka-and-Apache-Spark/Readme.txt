Docker run to launch the containers:
$ docker run –ti -d –p 9092:9092 –name=kafkaServer kafka
command has to be run to start a kafka container.
$ docker run –it -d –p 8112:8112 --name=webserver nodejs
command to start a nodejs (webserver running on port 8112) container
$ docker run –it apachespark command to start a spark container.
Run the following commands on Kafka:
Kafka server, zookeeper are started automatically
$ docker ps to get the container_id
I used docker exec to get into the running machine and create a topic(
this will give the user to choose the topic name)
$ docker exec –it container_id /bin/bash
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper 192.168.99.100:2181 --
replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic redhat
Note: IP will vary.
Run the following commands on nodejs:
$ docker ps to get the container_id
I used docker exec to get into the running machine and send the logs(
this will be automated soon)
$ docker exec –it container_id /bin/bash
$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 192.168.99.100:9092 --
topic redhat < http.logs
I setup a cron job to update the redhat topic every minute. Webserver
can also be modified to send logs directly to Kafka brokers. I used curl
command to send a get request to webserver and collected the logs. 

For now we need to create a file with random logs for testing purpose.
Lets assume the http.log file contains:
Rendering html page
Error in rendering
Rendering html page
Rendering html page
Rendering html page
Error in rendering
Error in rendering
Note: IP will vary.
Run the following commands on spark:
Everything is automated on the spark side, you will see just the error
logs extracted from all the logs by spark( python api). There’s a
entrypoint for this container which will basically run the following
command:
$ bin/spark-submit –master local[2] –jars /root/project_kafka/spark-
1.5.1-bin-hadoop2.6/spark-streaming-kafka-assembly_2.10-1.5.1.jar
examples/src/main/python/streaming/run.py 192.168.99.100:2181
redhat
You will see lot of logs along with time stamps where the output
appears. Please change the log4j settings to just show the WARN
messages if you don’t want to see the verbose logs which will contain
some warning errors which should not matter as the output is not
affected.
Note: IP will vary.
